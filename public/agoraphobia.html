    <h2><b>Agoraphobia is a fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult or that help wouldnt be available if things go wrong</b></h2>
    <p>Many people assume agoraphobia is simply a fear of open spaces, but it's actually a more complex condition</p>
    <p>someone with agoraphobia maybe scared of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>travelling on public transport</li>
        <li>visiting a shopping centre</li>
        <li>leaving home</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If someone with agoraphobia finds themselves in a stressful situation, they'll usually experience the symptoms of a panic attack, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>rapid heartbeat</li>
        <li>rapid breathing(hyperventilating)</li>
        <li>feeling hot and sweaty</li>
        <li>feeling sick</li>
    </ul>
    <p>they'll avoid situations that cause anxity and may only leave the house with a friend or partner. They'll order groceries nline rather than going to the supermarket. This change in behaviour is known as avoidance</p>
    <p><b>what causes agoraphobia?</b></p>
    <p>Agoraphobia can devekop as a complication of panic disorder, an anxiety disorder involoving panic attacks and moments of intense fear. It can arise by associating panic attacks with the places or situations where they occured by avoiding them.</p>
    <p>Not all people with agoraphobia have a history of panic attacks. In these cases, their fear may be related to issues like a fear of crime, terrorism, illness or being in an accident</p>
    <p><b>Diagnosing agoraphobia</b></p>
    <p>Speak to your GP if you think you may be affected by agoraphobia. It should be possible to arrange a telephone consultation if you don't feel ready to visit your GP in person.</p>
    <p>Your GP will ask you to describe your symptomms, how often they occur and in what situations. It's very important you tell them how you've been feeling and how your symptoms are affecting you.</p>
    <p>Your GP may ask you the following questions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Do you find leaving the house stressful?</li>
        <li>Are there certain places or situations you have to avoid?</li>
        <li>Do you have any avoidance strategies to help youy cope with your symptoms, such as relying on others to shop for you</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It can sometimes be difficult to talk about your feelings, emotions and personal life, but try not to feel anxious or embarrassed. Your GP needs to know as much as possible about your symptoms to make the correct diagnosis and recommend the most appropriate treatment</p>
